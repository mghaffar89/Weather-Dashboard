Homework 6

## Live App

## Description

Given the task to make the weather available to any user whether they are travelling or need to know the status in multiple cities, I created a web application where a city can be searched and saved to show not only the current weather but a five day forecast. The app gives a multitude of information for the user so that they can get the exact feel of the city they wish to visit.

## Future Development

Given more time I would work out any errors and make the code cleaner. Coming up with a way to call functions and pull from APIs in a more organized manner.
